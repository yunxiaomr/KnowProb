## 📘 Overview
Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) are trained on large amounts of unlabeled data, and they exhibit remarkable reasoning skills. However, the trustworthiness challenges have become increasingly evident. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel knowledge-guided probing approach called KnowProb in a post-hoc explanation way, which aims to probe whether black-box PLMs understand implicit knowledge beyond the given text, rather than focusing only on the surface-level content of the text.
